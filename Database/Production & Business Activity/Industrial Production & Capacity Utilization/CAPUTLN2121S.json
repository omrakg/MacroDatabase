The Federal Reserve Board's capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainable maximum output-the greatest level of output a plant can maintain within the framework of a realistic work schedule, after factoring in normal downtime and assuming sufficient availability of inputs to operate the capital in place.\n\nFor more information, see the explanatory notes (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/About.htm) issued by the Board of Governors.
