  "notes": "The \u201cConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food & Energy\u201d is an aggregate of prices paid by urban consumers for a typical basket of goods, excluding food and energy. This measurement, known as \u201cCore CPI,\u201d is widely used by economists because food and energy have very volatile prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines and measures the official CPI, and more information can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm or here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/cpihom.pdf."
