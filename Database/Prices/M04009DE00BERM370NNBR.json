Because Of Inflation, By 1923 Prices Had Ranged From 2,000,000 To 24,500,000,000 Paper Marks Per 100 Kilograms Of Wool. Data For August-December, 1923 Are Quoted Directly In Gold Marks And Are Prices From The 15Th Of The Month Instead Of Monthly Averages. Beginning In November, 1923, Prices Are From Leipzig. The Same Grade Of Wool Is Used.
