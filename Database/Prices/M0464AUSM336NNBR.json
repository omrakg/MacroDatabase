  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables-- (1)--Original Data, 1913-1951 (2)--Original Data,1947-1954. See 1931 Bls Bulletin For Revisions From 1926-1931. Beginning In 1935, Revised Indexes Are Based Upon A Larger Sample Of Lumber Prices And An Improved Method Of Weighting Is Used. The Price Data Were Not Available For An Adequate Number Of Types Of Lumber To Make It Feasible To Compute Revised Indexes Prior To January, 1935. However, A Continuous Index (1926=100) Has Been Constructed Using The Revised Index For January, 1935 At The Same Level As The Series Which It Replaces. In October, 1940, The Bls Lumber Index Was Revised Back To January, 1935. Figures For November And December, 1942, Were Shown In Monthly Wholesale Prices (Mimeographed) For April, 1944; Not Published Elsewhere. Figures For September-December, 1943 Were Shown In Monthly Wholesale Prices (Mimeographed) For June 1945; Not Published Elsewhere. After December, 1951, Index On 1926 Base Was Discontinued.
