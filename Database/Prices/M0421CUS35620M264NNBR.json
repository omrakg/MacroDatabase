  "notes": "Series Has Been Subdivided Into Two Variables: (1)-- Original Data, 1945-1952; (2) Original Data, 1951-1957. A New Price Is Quoted From October 1951 (Published Only From April 1952 On.) It Refers To \"Spirits Of Turpentine, Tank Cars, Per Gallon, F.O.B. New York.\" October 1951-March 1952 Data Was Furnished By Bls To NBER. In October 1956 There Was A Minor Change In The Specification For Turpentine, To \"Gum.\" No Price Was Quoted For October. The Index, However, Remained Unchanged. It Was Decided To Keep The Price Constant Through October. The Monthly Naval Stores Report (Agricultural Marketing Service) Shows That Prices Increased Somewhat In Late Fall Of 1956 And It Is Believed That The Price Quoted Under The Old Specification Would Have Increased Also. The Figures Are Considered Continuous. See \"Wholesale Prices And Price Indexes\", Bls, November 1956 (Final).
