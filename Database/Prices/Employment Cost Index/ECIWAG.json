In addition, several computational changes were introduced, including rebasing all series to December 2005=100 from June 1989=100, the introduction of new employment weights and seasonal adjustment factors.\r\nFor more detailed information on NAICS and SOC, including background and definitions, please see the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) websites:\u00a0https://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm (https://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm)\u00a0and\u00a0http://www.bls.gov/soc/home.htm (http://www.bls.gov/soc/home.htm)."
