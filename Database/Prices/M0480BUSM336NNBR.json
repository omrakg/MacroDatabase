This Series Represents The Average Of Prices Of One Popular Car And Is Available Through 1937. A Revised Index Which Takes Into Account Price Changes In Three Styles Of Chassis (4-Door, 2-Door, And Coupe) Was Available Annually Plus A December Figure During 1927-1936 And Monthly Thereafter. The NBER Has Therefore Adjusted The July 1927-1936 Data In The First Series By The Annual And December Figures In The Revised Series To Make A Continuous Second Segment. The Previous Segment Is Lowered To The Level Of This One By The Ratio Of The Overlapping Segment July, 1927-January, 1928: 677.3 Divided By 720.3 Equals 0.940. Source: Computed By NBER From Bls Data For January-June, 1937; For July 1937 On, Bls \"Wholesale Prices\".\n\nThis NBER data series m04180b appears on the NBER website in Chapter 4 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter04.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m04180b"
