To make these adjustments, we use the X-12 Procedure of SAS to remove the seasonal component of the series so that non-seasonal trends can be analyzed. This procedure is based on the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on this program can be found at https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/.\nThe seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureau\u2019s X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed.

The new methodology uses the latest and most accurate data mapping of listing statuses to yield a cleaner and more consistent measurement of active listings at both the national and local level. The methodology has also been adjusted to better account for missing data in some fields including square footage. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the data released since December 2021 will not be directly comparable with previous data releases (files downloaded before December 2021) and Realtor.com\u00ae economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.

Annual chained-type Fisher indices are used in BEA's national income and product accounts (NIPAs) whereby Fisher ideal price indices are calculated using the weights of adjacent years. Those annual changes are then multiplied (chained) together, forming the chained-type index time series. Chain-type indexes or chain-dollar estimates are used when you want to show how output or spending has changed over time. The percent changes in quantity indexes exactly match the percent changes in chained dollars, so they can be used interchangeably for making comparisons. Real estimates remove the effects of price changes, which can obscure changes in output or spending in current dollars.\n\nFor more information about this release go to http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm.",

    "notes": "The supply score is an index representing a zip code, county or metro's median days on market ranking compared to other zip codes, counties or metros.\n\nWith the release of its November 2021 housing trends report, Realtor.com\u00ae incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting housing inventory trends and metrics. The new methodology uses the latest and most accurate data mapping of listing statuses to yield a cleaner and more consistent measurement of active listings at both the national and local level. The methodology has also been adjusted to better account for missing data in some fields including square footage. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the data released since December 2021 will not be directly comparable with previous data releases (files downloaded before December 2021) and Realtor.com\u00ae economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.
