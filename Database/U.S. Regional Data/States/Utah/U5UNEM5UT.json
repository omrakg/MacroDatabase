  "notes": "U-5 unemployment rate, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nThe BLS defines discouraged workers as persons who are not in the labor force, want and are available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They are not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the prior 4 weeks, for the specific reason that they believed no jobs were available to them.\n\nThe BLS criteria for marginally attached workers are the same as for discouraged workers, with the exception that any reason could have been cited for the lack of job search in the prior 4 weeks. The marginally attached are a group that includes discouraged workers."
