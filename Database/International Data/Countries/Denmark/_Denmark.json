    "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) \"Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN)\" attempts to identify governmental influence on the prices of goods and services.\n\nFor a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.\n\nFor some European Union member states, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes; for other European Union member states, these are provided by national central banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.\n\nInformation provided in the notes relating to Administered Prices HICP classifications can be found from the source at:\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/methodology/hicp-administered-prices.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

Rentals are all rentals actually paid by tenants, i.e. the rentals the tenant pays to the landlord regardless of any social benefits the tenant receives from public authorities (including payments which at the tenant's discretion go directly to the landlord). Rentals normally include payment for the use of the land on which the property stands, the dwelling occupied, the fixtures and fittings for heating, plumbing, lighting, etc., and, in the case of a dwelling let furnished, the furniture.\n\nRentals also include payment for the use of a garage to provide parking in connection with the dwelling. The garage does not have to be physically contiguous to the dwelling; nor does it have to be leased from the same landlord.\n\nThis category excludes accommodation services of educational establishments and hostels (11.2.0), of holiday villages and holiday centers (11.2.0), and of retirement homes for elderly persons (12.4.0). Rentals also do not include payment for the use of garages or parking spaces not providing parking in connection with the dwelling (07.2.4). Nor do they include charges for water supply (04.4.1), refuse collection (04.4.2), and sewerage collection (04.4.3); co-proprietor charges for caretaking, gardening, stairwell cleaning, heating and lighting, maintenance of lifts and refuse disposal chutes, etc. in multi-occupied buildings (04.4.4); charges for electricity (04.5.1) and gas (04.5.2); and charges for heating and hot water supplied by district heating plants (04.5.5).\n\nThis is a subcategory of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels (04) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings are distinguished by two features. First, they are activities that have to be undertaken regularly in order to maintain the dwelling in good working order. Second, they do not change the dwelling's performance, capacity or expected service life. Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings includes minor tasks commonly carried out by both tenants and owners, such as interior decoration and repairs to fittings. Also includes major tasks carried out by owners only, such as plastering walls or repairing roofs. Only expenditures, which tenants and owner- occupiers incur on materials and services for minor maintenance and repair, are part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Expenditures, which owner-occupiers incur on materials and services for major maintenance and repair, are not part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Purchases of materials made by tenants or owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking the maintenance or repair themselves should be shown under (04.3.1). If tenants or owner-occupiers pay an enterprise to carry out the maintenance or repair, the total value of the service, including the costs of the materials used, should be shown under (04.3.2).\n\nThis category contains the Materials for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.1) and Services for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.2) subcategories.\n\nThis is a subcategory of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels (04) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

    "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category \"Hospital Services (06.3)\" is a classification of services that includes basic services: administration; accommodation; food and drink; supervision and care by non-specialist staff (nursing auxiliaries), first-aid and resuscitation; ambulance transport; provision of medicines and other pharmaceutical products; provision of therapeutic appliances and equipment; medical services: services of physicians in general or specialist practice, of surgeons and of dentists; medical analyses and X-rays; paramedical services such as those of nurses, midwives, chiropractors, optometrists, physio-therapists, speech therapists, etc. Hospitalization is defined as occurring when a patient is accommodated in a hospital for the duration of the treatment. Hospital day care and home-based hospital treatment are included as are hospices for terminally-ill persons. This group covers the services of general and specialist hospitals, the services of medical centers, maternity centers, nursing homes, and convalescence homes, which chiefly provide in-patient health care, the services of institutions serving old people in which medical monitoring is an essential component and the services of rehabilitation centers providing in-patient health care and rehabilitative therapy where the objective is to treat the patient rather than to provide long-term support. Hospitals are defined as institutions that offer in-patient care under direct supervision of qualified medical doctors. Medical centers, maternity centers, nursing homes, and convalescent homes also provide in-patient care, but their services are supervised and frequently delivered by staff of lower qualification than medical doctors.\n\nThis category excludes the services of facilities, such as surgeries, clinics, and dispensaries, devoted exclusively to out-patient care (06.2). Nor does it include the services of retirement homes for elderly persons, institutions for disabled persons and rehabilitation centers providing primarily long-term support (12.4).\n\nThis category is a subcategory of the Health (06) categories.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

In terms of financial instruments, credit covers loans and debt securities.(1)\n\nThe combination of different sources and data from various methodological frameworks resulted in breaks in the series. The BIS is therefore, in addition, publishing a second set of series adjusted for breaks, which covers the same time span as the unadjusted series. The break-adjusted series are the result of the BIS's own calculations, and were obtained by adjusting levels through standard statistical techniques described in the special feature on the long credit series of the March 2013 issue of the BIS Quarterly Review at https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1303h.htm.

    "notes": "A measure of degree of competition based on profit-efficiency in the banking market. It is calculated as the elasticity of profits to marginal costs. An increase in the Boone indicator implies a deterioration of the competitive conduct of financial intermediaries.\n\nA measure of degree of competition, calculated as the elasticity of profits to marginal costs. To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Cih\u00e1k 2010 with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs. Regional estimates of the Boone indicator pool the bank data by regions (for more information, see Hay and Liu 1997; Boone 2001; Boone, Griffith, and Harrison 2005).

The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of the trough. For more options on recession shading, see the notes and links below.\n\nThe recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications. A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be found at:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DNKRECM\n\nThe second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method is used for this series.\n\nThe third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series represented using the peak method can be found at:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DNKRECP\n\nThe OECD CLI system is based on the \"growth cycle\" approach, where business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production (IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final reference turning points in the growth cycle.\n\nZones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e. CLIs and IIPs).\n\nUp to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)\n\nThe components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points. Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and normalized components. The component series for each country are selected based on various criteria such as economic significance; cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.\n\nOECD data should be cited as follows: OECD Composite Leading Indicators, \"Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning Points and Component Series\", http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm (Accessed on date)",

For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A version of this time series represented using the trough method can be found at:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DNKREC\n\nThe third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The peak method is used for this series.\n\nThe OECD CLI system is based on the \"growth cycle\" approach, where business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production (IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final reference turning points in the growth cycle.\n\nZones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e. CLIs and IIPs).\n\nUp to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)\n\nThe components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points. Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and normalized components. The component series for each country are selected based on various criteria such as economic significance; cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.\n\nOECD data should be cited as follows: OECD Composite Leading Indicators, \"Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning Points and Component Series\", http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm (Accessed on date)",
