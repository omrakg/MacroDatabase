  "notes": "This series is calculated by using in the numerator loans collateralized by commercial real estate, loans to construction companies, and loans to companies active in the development of real estate; and gross loans as the denominator. It is an asset quality ratio, which measures banks exposure to the commercial real estate market. A high concentration of the loan portfolio in real estate signals the potential existence of an important vulnerability in the financial system.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, International Monetary Fund.
