The Figure, 113.2, Is Given By De Bernonville In Journal De La Societe De Statistique De Paris, June 1924, P.244. It Will Be Noted That The Quarterly Data As Thus Converted Will Agree With The Quarterly Averages Computed From Monthly Data, Beginning In 1913. For A Description Of The Index, See Journal De Societe De Statistique De Paris, June, 1924, P.234, And The Sources Mentioned In \"Sources\" Above. Monthly Data Are For The End Of The Month.
