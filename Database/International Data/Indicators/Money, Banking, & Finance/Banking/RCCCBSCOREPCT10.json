  "notes": "The 10th percentile credit score among credit card accounts. The current credit score is the most recently determined commercially available credit score of the primary account holder. If an updated commercial credit bureau score is not available or is not currently being used by the reporting institution to evaluate the primary account holder's creditworthiness, the institution is instructed to map the most current internal credit score used to evaluate the primary account holder's creditworthiness to a commercially available credit bureau score. The source of the current credit score may vary by FR Y-14M reporting firm and even within the firm's reporting. Only credit card accounts with current credit scores between 150 and 950 are included in the current credit score percentile calculations.
