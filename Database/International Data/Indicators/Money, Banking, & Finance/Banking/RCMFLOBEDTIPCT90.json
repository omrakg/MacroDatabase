  "notes": "The 90th percentile back-end debt-to-income ratio among first lien originations. The back-end DTI ratio is the percentage of a borrower's monthly income that would go toward all the borrower's debt obligations. The total monthly debt payments (including proposed housing expenses) are divided by the total monthlyincome of the borrower. Back-end DTI is reported at origination. These data include total bank loans originated and held in portfolio in a given quarter, including those that will later be sold or securitized.
