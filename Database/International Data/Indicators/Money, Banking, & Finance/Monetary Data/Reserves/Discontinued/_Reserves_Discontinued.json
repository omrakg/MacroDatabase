    "notes": "By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to the sum of credit extended through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs and credit extended through certain Federal Reserve liquidity facilities. Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve are presented in table 1a of the release. Over much of 2008, in order to maintain a level of total reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's objective for the federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves were offset through a nearly commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which was accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities and other assets. The negative level of nonborrowed reserves was an arithmetic result of the fact that borrowings from the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities were larger than total reserves.\n\nThis series has been discontinued. As of July 11, 2013 data in the new H.3 statistical release are no longer adjusted for regulatory changes in reserve requirements and are no longer seasonally adjusted.

    "notes": "The series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nThis series has been discontinued because Non-borrowed reserves are no longer reported as seasonally adjusted on the H.3 release. On December 12, 2007, the Federal Reserve created the Term Auction Facility (TAF) to improve depository institutions' access to term funding. The TAF provided credit through an auction mechanism to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition. The TAF offered 28-day and, beginning in August 2008, 84-day loans.\n\nOn September 24, 2009, the Federal Reserve announced that the TAF would be scaled back in response to continued improvements in financial market conditions. The auction amount for the 84-day auctions was reduced in late 2009 and the maturity dates of the 84-day auctions were adjusted over time to align with the maturity dates of the 28-day auctions. Subsequently, the auction amount for the remaining 28-day auctions was tapered, and the final TAF auction was held on March 8, 2010. Credit extended under the March 2010 auction matured on April 8, 2010. All TAF loans were fully collateralized to the satisfaction of the lending Reserve Bank, with an appropriate \"haircut\" applied to the value of the collateral and were repaid in full, with interest, in accordance with the terms of the facility.",

The penalty-free band replaces carryover and routine penalty waivers effective with the Regulation D changes on June 27, 2013. This series equals the sum of each institution's top of the penalty-free band. For each institution, the top of the penalty-free band is equal to the institution's reserve balance requirement plus an amount that is the greater of 10 percent of the institution's reserve balance requirement or $50,000.\n\nEffective February 2, 1984, reserve computation and maintenance periods have been changed from weekly to bi-weekly. Series with data prior to February 2, 1984 have different values reported from one week to the next. After February 2, 1984, the value repeats for 2 consecutive weeks.",
