  "notes": "The series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis using data derived from the H.3 and H.4.1. releases.\n\nThis series has been discontinued with a phase of the simplification of reserves administration (https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-8562). Contractual clearing balance program was eliminated on July 12, 2012.\nNevertheless, to get at the historical concept of Excess reserves using the new H.3 statistical release, take Total reserve balances maintained less Reserve balance requirements. Alternatively, one can view excess as the amount of balances maintained that satisfy the minimum requirements, which can be calculated by taking Total reserve balances maintained less Bottom of penalty-free band."
