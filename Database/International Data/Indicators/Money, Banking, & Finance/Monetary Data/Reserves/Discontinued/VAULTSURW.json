For more information, please see the announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h3.html) posted on August 20, 2020.\n\nVault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements that's held by institutions not exempt from reserve requirements. This series is calculated as Total vault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements, held by institutions not exempt from reserve requirements (TLVAULTW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TLVAULTW), minus the amount used to satisfy reserve requirements (VAULTW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAULTW).\n\nEffective February 2, 1984, reserve computation and maintenance periods have been changed from weekly to bi-weekly. Series with data prior to February 2, 1984 have different values reported from one week to the next. After February 2, 1984, the value repeats for 2 consecutive weeks."
