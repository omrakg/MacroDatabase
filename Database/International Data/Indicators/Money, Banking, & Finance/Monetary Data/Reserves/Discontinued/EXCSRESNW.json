For more information, please see the announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h3.html) posted on August 20, 2020.\n\nSeries is calculated using data from the H.3 release as Total reserve balances maintained (RESBALNSW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RESBALNSW) less Reserve balance requirements (RESBALREQW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RESBALREQW).\n\nEffective February 2, 1984, reserve computation and maintenance periods have been changed from weekly to bi-weekly. Series with data prior to February 2, 1984 have different values reported from one week to the next. After February 2, 1984, the value repeats for 2 consecutive weeks.\n\nPlease note though that this historical concept of \"excess reserves\" no longer has the same meaning following phase two of the simplification of reserves administration. https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-8562"
