For more information, please see the announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h3.html) posted on August 20, 2020.\n\nReserve balance requirements series is the portion of the reserve requirements not satisfied by vault cash. The series is calculated as Required reserves (REQRESNSW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REQRESNSW) less Vault cash used to satisfy required reserves (VAULTW) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAULTW).\n\nEffective February 2, 1984, reserve computation and maintenance periods have been changed from weekly to bi-weekly. Series with data prior to February 2, 1984 have different values reported from one week to the next. After February 2, 1984, the value repeats for 2 consecutive weeks."
