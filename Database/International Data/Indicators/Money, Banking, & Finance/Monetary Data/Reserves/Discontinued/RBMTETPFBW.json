For more information, please see the announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h3.html) posted on August 20, 2020.\n\nBalances maintained that exceed the top of the penalty-free band is calculated separately for each institution and then aggregated. If an institution maintains an average level of reserve balances over a maintenance period above the top of its penalty-free band, then balances maintained that exceed the top of the penalty-free band is equal to the institution's average level of reserve balances maintained over a maintenance period less the top of its penalty-free band. For all other institutions, balances maintained that exceed the top of the penalty-free band is zero. This series equals the sum of balances maintained that exceed the top of each institution's penalty-free band.\n\nEffective February 2, 1984, reserve computation and maintenance periods have been changed from weekly to bi-weekly. Series with data prior to February 2, 1984 have different values reported from one week to the next. After February 2, 1984, the value repeats for 2 consecutive weeks."
