  "notes": "Household is an occupied housing unit.\n Householder is a person in whose name the housing unit is rented or owned. This person must be at least 15 years old.\n Family household is a household in which there is at least 1 person present who is related to the householder by birth, marriage or adoption. \n Family is used to refer to a family household. In general, family consists of those related to each other by birth, marriage or adoption.\n\n This data uses the householder's person weight to describe characteristics of people living in households. As a result, estimates of the number of households do not match estimates of households from the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS). The HVS is weighted to housing units, rather than the population, in order to more accurately estimate the number of occupied and vacant housing units.
