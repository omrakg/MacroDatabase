There Was No Official Figure For January, 1910. Ox And Cow Hides Were Given Separately For 1914-1919 And 1926-34 (With Some Gaps) And Are Converted To A Simple Average Of The Two Quotations Each Month. Data For 08/1917-12/1917 Are Not Strictly Comparable. Steer Hides Instead Of Ox Hides Were Used, And November And December Are For Hides Without Heads.
