  "notes": "Data For 1858 And 1859 Were Computed By NBER By Averaging All The Weekly High And Low Quotations Falling Within Any Month. Either 8 Or 10 Quotations Were Averaged. This Method Was Also Used By Wallace For The Period 1860-1880 From This Same Source. Wallace Ends In 1919 And The Years 1920-1940 Have Been Computed By NBER By Averaging The Monthly High And Low As They Appear In The Annual Report Of The Chicago Board Of Trade. The Grade Used Here Was \"Heavy Packing, 250-500 Pounds,\" To Continue The Grade Specified By Wallace. The Wallace Data, 1896 To 1919, Was Compiled By Charles A.S. Mccracken For The Chicago Drovers Journal Yearbook. For 1881-1895, Inclusive, The Average Of The Range Of Chicago Hog Prices, As Compiled By The Cincinnati Price Current Have Been Used. These Prices Refer More Nearly To Average Hogs Than To Heavy Hogs. Previous To 1881, Prices Have Been Compiled From Chicago Board Of Trade Reports, The Grade Known As Heavy Packers And Shippers Being Used So Far As Possible. A Strike From November 21-December 3, 1938 Resulted In Practically No Sales. Source: For 1858, 1859, 1920-1940, Annual Reports Of Chicago Board Of Trade For The Specific Year. For 1860-1919, H.A.
