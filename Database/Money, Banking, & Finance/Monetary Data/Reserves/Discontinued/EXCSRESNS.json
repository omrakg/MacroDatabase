For more information, please see the announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h3.html) posted on August 20, 2020.\n\nSeries is calculated using data from the H.3 release as Total reserve balances maintained (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RESBALNS) less Reserve balance requirements (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RESBALREQ).\n\nPlease note though that this historical concept of \"excess reserves\" no longer has the same meaning following phase two of the simplification of reserves administration. For more information, see the Reserves Simplification Rule (https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-8562)."
