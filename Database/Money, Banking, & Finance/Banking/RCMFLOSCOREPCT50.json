  "notes": "The 50th percentile credit score among first lien originations. The original credit score is the credit score at origination for the borrower using a commercially available credit score. The original credit score provider may vary by FR Y-14M reporting firm and even within the firm's reporting. Only mortgage accounts with credit scores between 150 and 950 are included in the original credit score percentile calculations. These data include total bank loans originated and held in portfolio in a given quarter, including those that will later be sold or securitized.
