For alternative data in FRED similar to the discontinued series, see QBPLNTLNNTCGOFFR (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QBPLNTLNNTCGOFFR), which is part of the FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=482). Additional consolidated data is available on the FDIC's Bank Data and Statistics (https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/).\n\nCharge-offs are measured on a net basis-loans charged off as losses minus recoveries on loans preciously charged off. The percentage of loans charged off as losses each quarter (net of recoveries on loans previously charged off as losses) is calculated by summing net charge-off for all banks in the size group and dividing by the sum of their total loans. Data are annualized.\nNet Charge-offs is the difference between Charge-offs on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses call item RIAD4635 and Recoveries on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses call item RIAD4605. Total loans equals Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income call item RCFD2122.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.\n\nThis series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using raw data that are collected by the FFIEC. Raw data can be found at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/."
